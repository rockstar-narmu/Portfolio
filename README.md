# My Beginner Portfolio 🌸

This is a **practice portfolio website** I created to learn and explore **HTML**, **CSS**, **Flexbox**, and **Grid layout**.  
It’s not my current portfolio, but it holds a special place in my journey as a budding frontend developer 💖

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me understand:
- How to structure multi-section websites
- Responsive layout with Flexbox and Grid
- Designing clean sections for portfolios
- Styling forms, text, and sections consistently

## 🧩 Sections Included

The portfolio has 5 main sections:

1. **Main Section** – A welcome/introduction area
